## IS340: Empower 
Madison Park, Spring 2024


### Abstract   
In this paper, I will be outlining the strategies and technology to build my open-source project Empower - a open source community and platform for accurate and up-to-date information on birth control, accessibility in relation to location and local laws, and a women’s narratives and experiences with their contraceptive choices.

### Introduction


#### Purpose
After the overturning Roe v. Wade resulting in regions of the United states without access to abortion rights and women's health resources, there is confusion on how this also impacts access to contraceptive resources and care. Today many women take to social media to share their opinons and information on this topic due to the ambiguity regarding the state of contraceptive access(Tsiandoulas, 2023). Contraceptive users tend to look toward and trust more anecdotal and informal sources of personal experiences with contraceptive options and experiences due to specialists giving vague and universalized experiences to potential side effects (Yee and Simon, 2010).

However, this introduces an environment to quickly spread misinformation on contraceptive use and access. This is especially harmful to young demographics primarily using social media gaining incorrect sexual health advice and creating a confusing community on reproductive rights. 

The purpose of Empower is to provide centralized platform that mitigates and addresses misinformation regarding contraceptives and provides clarity on avaiblaility of reproductive health and options. The main goal is to empower individuals and communities to be informed and connect with a mix of informational and anecdotal interactions that are accurate.   

#### Project Vision  
The end goal is to create a unified platform that has credible information on contraceptive information but also allows for community members to add to participate with their own narratives and experiences. Instead of having to read through multiple articles and websites , Empower will act as a place with clear information on recent updates on laws, rights, options, and accessibility regarding contraceptives and similar sexual autonomy care. It’s goal is to raise awareness to sexual health, destigmatize the talk around contraceptives, and bring clarity as this health space changes due to the legal landscape.

#### Open-Source Solution        
The foundation of Empower is to introduce collaboration at an early stage to foster a tool with many voices. Since this is a platfrom that focuses on access to contraceptive information in the states, the primary contributions would come from participants in the U.S. who are able to give their experiences. With this open collaborative format, Empower welcomes a open development, exchange, collaboration, integrity with the accurate information and intentionality in building a community in both the development stage and the product stage of bringing Empower to life. 

Empower also welcomes all identities passionate about empowered decisions regarding de stigmatizing birth control and is built on a team of software engineers, data scientists, designers, health professionals, and community members narratives. 

The open and collaborative structure of Empower is founded on the democratic access to this relevant and impactful information - and to bring this democratic process to the development is the goal as well to ensure a tool that has an impactful mission from the start. Github is the main platform that will be utilized for easy access and up to date progress cross the team to due it trusted version control and collaborative tools for teams. The goal is to allow a open environment for contributors to feel empowered to build a real world tool they see fitting into their needs and have story in contraceptive users journey.

Contributors working more closely with the code, can fork the repository, branch for contributions, add content with pull requests and all contributions can be reviewed for accurate information and code fixes. The main goal is to get code contributions, content creation to add to a database of information, user/contributor stories and feedback, a place to also access digital assets for design uploads to reference, and documentation on the process and story of creating an impact. On a more scoping level, Github’s project boards will be used fro progress tracking.

#### Audience
The main audiences of Empower are: contraceptive users who may be concerned about accessibility or switching to another option. Young adults (18-25 years old) who primarily use social media to learn about sexual health to gain another resources on accurate narratives on contraceptives. Women of all ages who are seeking more information on birth control options. Individuals who may be in regions with limited/impaired access to reproductive healthcare.

While the primary audience would be more female oriented, Empowers goal is still to be an open place for all gender identities to feel they are seen and can gain accurate information they may be seeking.


### Strategy


#### Collaboration
To reach the goals of Empower collaboration is key in development, design, documentation, and version control for a cohesive and smooth process. Today a popular strategy for collaboration in the development stage is leveraging Github and it’s industry standard version control capabilities. With the centralized location to access the most up to date contributions and build off one another’s additions while maintaining a clear process of code reviews and security. Github creates the main touch point for team members to have universal access to the both the main team and community contributions while having the layers of approval to maintain the credible and accurate information Empower is also aiming to uphold. The main team of maintainers + content checkers are able to push updates and contributions that are made at a community level and also closely review team members work. 

Keeping track of progress in a complex project is crucial. GitHub Projects or a similar tool within GitHub allows the team to visualize workflow using Kanban boards. This provides transparency for both internal team members and the broader community, fostering a sense of shared ownership and progress. The metrics also help visualize member activity in both development and content. By leveraging GitHub's core features and fostering a collaborative environment, "Empower" can ensure effective management of diverse contributions, content accuracy, and transparent progress –  all vital elements for the sustainability of this impactful community initiative.

#### Tech Stack
To build Empower, our development team with be using a framework on React.js which is a  offer flexibility, performance, and a large developer community for support. React Javascript libraries have become popular in front-end development and means there are also much support and resources to also reference. React will aid in building a dynamic and responsive web app interface for scalability and a cohesive user experience on both web + mobile. The capability to save time and extra labor on styling is also saved on the component-based workflow making it easier to have reusable code for the UI.

For the backend, we will use Python with Django frameworks that are also a popular option in the developer community. It also allows for a scaleable framework and seamless communication in the development of both the front end and backend. This is especially important for an open-source project like Empower, where a diverse developer pool is contributing. We will also use libraries like Axios to make API requests and fetch data from the backend. Libraries like Axios make efficient API requests from the frontend to the Django backend, ensuring smooth data retrieval and display on the platform. 

Additionally, a relational database like PostgreSQL to store structured information like contraceptive details, legal updates, etc. Empower relies on storing structured information like contraceptive details, legal updates, location data, and potentially anonymized user experiences. PostgreSQL, a robust relational database management system (RDBMS), provides a efficient way to store and manage such interconnected data. PostgreSQL enforces data integrity through features like constraints and triggers, ensuring the accuracy and consistency of information within the platform. It also offers advanced features like geospatial data support, which could be useful for future functionalities like location-specific legal updates.

We are also looking to implement a headless CMS like Contentful. This allows non-technical users, including healthcare professionals and community members, to easily update contraceptive information, legal updates, and other content without needing direct access to the codebase.

#### User Centric Design
With the heavy emphasis on engagement with community members, Empower wants to bring its core values on accuracy, transparency, impact, and community in its user-centric design to create a safe and relevant space for people with existing knowledge on the sexual health legal space to new members unfamiliar with knowledge space. Because Empower also focuses on destigmatizing the conversations around contraceptive access and reproductive health within youth and minorities, we look to create a approachable platform that has an emphasis on accessibility and intuitive information architecture and navigation to allow for access to essential information to be frictionless and empowering to personal users reproductive health choices.

Key features in core functionality can be seen in a contraceptive information database: a comprehensive and up-to-date information resource on various contraceptive methods, including effectiveness, potential health requirements, side effects, and user experiences which is anonymized. Search and filtering that allow users to search for specific contraceptives, can search for brands, side effects, and additional laws/regulations. Empower also has accessibility resources and information on accessing contraceptives in different locations, including local clinics and healthcare providers in.a map view to allow for a more interactive and visual cue for users, but also a search for quicker location finding. Finally, legal updates for updated legal information regarding contraceptive access in different regions to keep users informed.
There is also a large focus on community and how to get members' narratives to be an important part of both the community building but the relevant information provided. Here we aim for user narratives and anonymity with anonymous narrative submission. Users can submit anonymized narratives about their experiences with different contraceptives. This allows them to share personal stories openly without fear of judgment or identification. But for safe and accurate information there is content moderation and review on submissions. A robust moderation system with a dedicated team or volunteers trained to review narratives for sensitive content and ensure anonymity is maintained. Also, utilize trigger words and automated filtering to identify potentially harmful or misleading information within submitted narratives. Flag such submissions for further review by moderators. For further community safety, there is also reporting capabilities on potentially harmful submissions.

Narratives are also able to connect to searches. Users can search filters by user experience: filter contraceptive searches based on desired user experience categories (e.g., "Effectiveness," "Side Effects," "Long-term Use"). During submission, users can also tag their narratives with relevant keywords related to their experience. Integrate these tags into the search functionality to surface relevant narratives alongside factual information. In designing the UI there will be clear distinction between factual information about contraceptives and user narratives within search results. Utilizing icons or labels to avoid confusion.

To work toward combating misinformation from social media as well, Empower has established clear community guidelines outlining expectations for respectful discourse, accurate information sharing, and flagging of misinformation. And looking toward educational resources to expand the platform's content strategy to include educational resources on sexual health, reproductive rights, and identifying misinformation online.
In the design process, the design team will go through user research and survey / interview collection from the target audience and gain a deeper understanding of pain points in contraceptive access and information searching. Develop a content strategy outlining the types of information to be included (contraceptive details, side effects, legal updates, user experiences), content sources (medical professionals, community members), and editorial guidelines for maintaining accuracy and clarity. Then go through phases of design and AB testing to work from low fidelity to high fidelity designs. Finally, designers will use collaboration tools like Figma as the primary software to design and home visual assets and feedback on design elements. Design updates will also be shared with the broader community through platforms like Github discussions or community forums to gather feedback and foster a sense of ownership.

By prioritizing these features, "Empower" can create a valuable community resource while safeguarding user privacy, combating misinformation, and ultimately empowering users with accurate information and authentic experiences.

#### Funding Mechanisms 
The primary method of funding would be through grants from either university or research groups to start on a smaller scale and be in a more focused group / community before branching to a wider user group with more funding resources. Empower is looking toward public health grants by approaching government agencies or public health organizations that fund initiatives promoting sexual health education and access to reproductive healthcare resources. An example of this is the Title X Family Planning Services Grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services. An additional avenue is in foundational grants with research foundations focused on women's health, reproductive rights, or technology for social good might be potential funders. Examples of this are The Ford Foundation working to advance social justice including reproductive rights and bodily autonomy and The Wikimedia Foundation giving support to the communities creating free knowledge and educational content around the world. The Wikimedia Foundation offers various grants to support open-source projects like Wikipedia and other initiatives promoting free access to information.

For larger impact Empower would need to rely on larger funding sources such as the ones above, but to continue with the close community ties, will look to community based donations. By emphasizing Empower’s social impact, Empower will also be tied with more personal community member donations or crowdsourced donations.

### Conclusion      
Empower’s open-source platform development fosters a supportive community around accurate and up-to-date birth control information. In a world with information overload yet risks with potential limitations on access and misinformation regarding reproductive health spreading online, "Empower" aims to give individuals reproductive health choices. With a centralized fondation on credible information from its comprehensive database of birth control options, including effectiveness, side effects, and legal updates, ensures users have reliable resources. Community building with narratives and anonymity giving voice to safely share personal experiences, fostering a sense of connection and offering valuable insights beyond medical data. Ensuring safety by also combating misinformation with moderation tools, clear community guidelines, and educational resources equip users to identify and counter misinformation.
This collaborative approach, built on open-source principles, strengthens "Empower" with diverse perspectives in the community, enriching the platform's content and ensuring it reflects a broad range of experiences. This fosters shared ownership, promoting long-term project sustainability.
By building a safe and inclusive community space, "Empower" goes beyond information provision. It empowers individuals to make informed choices about their reproductive health, navigate legal complexities, and connect with others on this vital journey.
